Explanatory Notes

The United States Mortality DataBase mortality series includes period life table data indexed by calendar year for the following geographic units:

·      The United States as a whole (resident population)

·      The 4 Census Regions

·      The 9 Census Divisions

·      The 50 States and the District of Columbia

Format of Data Files

·      Data are available in two formats: tab-delimited text (ASCII) files and comma-separated (.CSV) files

·      Files are organized by state, sex, age, and calendar year

·      Life tables are provided in the following formats of age and time:

o   1x1 (by age in one-year age groups up to the open age interval 110+ years and by single calendar year)

o   1x5 (by age in one-year age groups up to the open age interval 110+ years and by 5-year time interval)

o   1x10 (by age in one-year age groups up to the open age interval 110+ years and by 10-year time interval)

o   5x1 (by five year group – 0, 1-4, 5-9, …, 105-109, 110+ - and by single calendar year)

o   5x5 (by five year group – 0, 1-4, 5-9, …, 105-109, 110+ - and by 5-year time interval)

o   5x10 (by five year group – 0, 1-4, 5-9, …, 105-109, 110+ - and by 10-year time interval)

The life tables include the following columns

Year     Calendar year or range of years of occurrence

Age      Age group for n-year interval from exact age x to just before exact age x+n

m(x)     Central death rate between age x and age x+n

q(x)      Probability of death between age x and age x+n

a(x)      Average length of survival between age x and age x+n for persons dying in the interval

l(x)       Number of survivors at exact age x, assuming l(0) = 100,000

d(x)      Number of deaths between age x and age x+n

L(x)      Number of person-years lived between age x and age x+n

T(x)      Number of person-years remaining after exact age x

e(x)      Life expectancy at exact age x (in years) = remaining length of life for survivors to age x
